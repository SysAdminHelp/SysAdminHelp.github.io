<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Daniel and I am a Junior System Administrator with an appreciation for System Administration/IT Operations . I have experience with Hyper V, Active Directory, Windows Server, DNS/DHCP, and scripting. I have worked predominantly in small and midsized businesses administering Office Suite/Office 365, enterprise servers(ranging from the HP NonStop system and UNIX/LINUX systems to Windows systems), and smaller computer networks.</p>
