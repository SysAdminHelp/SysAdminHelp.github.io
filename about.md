<p>I am Daniel, a dedicated Junior System Administrator with a strong passion for System Administration and IT Operations. I have accumulated valuable experience working in small and mid-sized businesses, where I have honed my skills in Hyper-V, Active Directory, Windows Server, DNS/DHCP, and scripting.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to administer Office Suite/Office 365 and support the IT infrastructure of SMBs. By managing enterprise servers and smaller  corporate computer networks, I have gained hands-on experience in maintaining the stability and functionality of critical systems.

While my experience has primarily been in SMBs, I am open to exploring opportunities in enterprise environments to further expand my knowledge and skills. I believe my expertise in Hyper-V, Active Directory, Windows Server, DNS/DHCP, and scripting can be effectively applied to larger-scale operations.

My proficiency in troubleshooting and resolving technical issues has allowed me to minimize downtime and optimize operational efficiency. I take pride in my ability to adapt quickly, identify opportunities for improvement, and implement effective solutions tailored to the specific needs of organizations.

I stay abreast of industry developments and emerging technologies to ensure that I provide the best possible support and deliver innovative solutions. My dedication to continuous learning and professional growth enables me to meet the evolving IT needs of businesses, streamline processes, and enhance overall productivity.

As a Junior System Administrator with experience in SMBs and a willingness to embrace enterprise opportunities, I am well-equipped to handle a variety of IT environments and contribute to the success of organizations through reliable system administration</p>
