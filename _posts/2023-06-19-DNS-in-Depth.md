## DNS: Function and Use Cases

Small and medium enterprise (SME) businesses need a strong online presence to remain competitive. A crucial component in achieving this is the Domain Name System (DNS), which serves SMEs in several essential areas, ensuring their online success.

**Domain Registration** enables SMEs to secure and register their desired domain names. This establishes a memorable online identity and fosters brand recognition. Additionally, DNS ensures seamless email delivery by configuring MX records, directing emails to the correct servers for efficient communication.

**Website Hosting** is facilitated by linking domain names to servers that host SMEs' websites. This simplifies customer access to their online presence. During peak web traffic periods for an SME, DNS-based load balancing can be enabled to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, ensuring optimal website performance.

**Disaster Recovery**  is achieved by having multiple DNS servers configured and having DNS failover implemented. This guarantees continuous availability of online services, even if one server experiences a failure.
