## What is the difference between the Per Technician vs Per User model 

When it comes to evaluating vendor management costs, organizations can choose between a per technician or per user cost basis. In the per technician approach, costs are calculated based on the number of technicians or IT staff involved in managing vendors. This includes expenses such as salaries, benefits, training, and additional resources dedicated to vendor management. On the other hand, the per user cost basis considers the number of end-users or employees who interact with vendors, dividing costs like licensing fees, support expenses, and training among the user base. The decision between these approaches depends on factors such as the organization's size, structure, and specific vendor management requirements. The per technician basis offers a more detailed breakdown of expenses related to vendor management, while the per user basis provides insight into the direct impact on individual users. Ultimately, the chosen cost basis should align with the organization's goals and financial structure, ensuring accurate and relevant cost evaluation.

## Advantages of each

**Per Technician Cost Basis:** This model is particularly useful when an organization has dedicated vendor management teams or specific personnel responsible for managing vendor relationships. It provides a granular breakdown of costs directly associated with vendor management, such as training, salaries, and resources allocated to technicians. The per technician cost basis is ideal for organizations that want to closely analyze the expenses related to their vendor management teams and assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations.

**Per User Cost Basis:** The per user cost basis is more suitable for organizations with a large user base that relies heavily on vendor services. It helps evaluate the impact of vendor management costs on individual users or employees. This model takes into account licensing fees, support costs, and training expenses, which can be spread across the user base. The per user cost basis is beneficial when the organization wants to understand the direct cost implications for each user and evaluate the overall value provided by vendors to the end-users.

## OPINION: Why the Per Technician model is the best

For small and medium-sized businesses, implementing a per technician cost basis for vendor management proves to be a practical and cost-effective choice. Limited resources, including personnel, necessitate optimizing resource allocation. Allocating costs based on the number of technicians responsible for vendor management ensures efficient resource utilization. Additionally, this approach enhances accountability and transparency, allowing for clear tracking of costs directly associated with the responsible technicians. The per technician cost basis also offers flexibility and scalability, enabling easy adjustments to accommodate the evolving needs of growing businesses. Furthermore, it supports cost control efforts by providing a focused analysis of vendor management expenses, facilitating identification of areas for improvement and cost optimization.
