 ## What is Computer Networking 
 A good way to think of networking would be that it is the practice of connecting devices to share resources and enable communication. It involves hardware devices, software protocols, and technologies that facilitate data transfer and collaboration among connected devices. Once two devices are connected to eachother, you basically have a computer network

 ## Cabling: Ethernet vs Fiber.
 At a granular level, there is a very very simple distinction between ethernet and fiber. Ethernet cables are based on twisted pairs of wires in a sleeve. The reason they are twisted is to aid in reducing electrical interference with the connection and in turn basically provides shielding. Fibre cables utilize light and not a twisted pair schema and in turn as basically almost as fast as the speed of light. From an small and medium business perspective, ethernet will most likely be your go to even though the copper used for ethernet cables is actually only dictated to be used for no more than 100 metres. Fibre cabling would be best to use for distances well beyond 100m, and is excellent for use by ISPs as they are often immune to electromagnetic and weather conditions.
