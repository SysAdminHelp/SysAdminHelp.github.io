## The Basics of Virtualization 
A virtualized PC, also known as a virtual machine (VM), is a software emulation of a physical computer system. It differs from a physical PC in several ways. Firstly, virtualized PCs provide hardware independence by abstracting and sharing the underlying hardware among multiple virtual machines. Each virtual machine runs independently, allowing different operating systems to be simultaneously operated regardless of the host OS. Resource allocation in virtualized PCs is dynamic, with CPU, memory, and disk space being allocated as needed. Snapshots enable the capturing of specific states for easy restoration, while mobility and portability facilitate the movement of virtual machines between physical machines. Virtualization is commonly used for server consolidation, reducing costs and energy consumption. Although virtualization introduces a performance overhead, advancements have minimized its impact. Overall, virtualized PCs require virtualization software and offer increased flexibility, scalability, and resource optimization.

## The CPU and Virtualization: Instruction Sets

Virtualization technologies, such as Intel's VT-x (Virtualization Technology) and VT-d (Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O), play a vital role in the efficient virtualization of PCs. These instructions, specifically designed for Intel processors, provide hardware-level support that significantly enhances virtualization capabilities. AMD's alternative is AMD-Vi.

VT-x is responsible for enabling the creation and execution of virtual machines. By allowing the hypervisor, the software managing the virtual machines, to run in a privileged mode known as "root mode" or "host mode," VT-x facilitates the smooth operation of virtual machines. It leverages hardware-assisted virtualization techniques, enabling efficient and secure execution of virtualized environments.

In addition, VT-d enhances virtualization by offering hardware-level support for direct memory access (DMA) and input/output (I/O) virtualization. This capability becomes particularly relevant when dealing with I/O devices. By isolating and managing these devices, VT-d enables virtual machines to directly access and control specific hardware components, such as network interfaces and storage devices. This direct access is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and security in virtualized environments.

It's important to note that the availability of VT-x and VT-d instructions varies depending on the specific processor model. Not all processors may support these instructions, so it is essential to consider processor compatibility when planning virtualization deployments. Nevertheless, for those processors that do support VT-x and VT-d, these technologies significantly contribute to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of virtualized PCs and other virtualization use cases, such as server virtualization.  

## Virtualization Implementation

A good way for a small and medium businesses to utilize virtualization would be to use it as a means to consolidate their physical infrastructure. Instead of having a physical print server, one could deploy a Windows Server VM with the print server being hosted there. The same could be applied to other infrastructures such as web servers. Through the use of the hypervisor settings, one could allocate resources such as CPU/RAM to optimally use as much physical resources as the physical virtualization server could afford to distribute. This helps keep inventory costs down for a business as well as allows for the scalability of deploying new services.
