## DNS Query and Traversal
THe traversal of your DNS Query of course depends on the content of the DNS Query. For example, initially while all DNS queries operate iteratively initially (going from your name server to your top level domain and finally to the one of the 13 root servers) and then recursively once it recieves the request (moving down the same hierarchy that it went up). However, depending on your query you may not need to even reach the root server and may be able to access cached information on the name server or top level domain server itself. The best way to remember this is that it is iterative until reaching its destination and then recursive from there. A DNS Query can have it's execution controlled by something called the TTL - which controls propogation via this DNS resolver.
