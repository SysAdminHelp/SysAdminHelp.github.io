## What is System Administration?

Unlike IT Support, System Administration is the field of administering server systems and computer networks (depending on if the SysAdmin is also the NetAdmin for that given organization). In order to do this successfully - a system administrator needs to adapt to various internal and external factors including but not limited to
* Architecture of the infrastructure
* Administration of the infrastructure 
* Vendor cost
* Nature of the business 
* Service Level Agreements 
* Asset Management
* Financial, Bureaucratic, and Operational constraints and risks
* Resistence to Change 
* Identity Access Management and Information Security/Cybersecurity.

This makes system administration **incredibly business centric**. In many organizations, a SystemAdmin **can control every piece of technology ranging from the doors (assuming digital locking system) to nearly every single endpoint through various enterprise and scripted/programmed solutions. They need to be able to perform their job at scale as best as possible. This means having a Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan, having good Asset Management, having a good framework for IAM(Onboarding, Offboarding, Least Privlege relative to role).** It also means having good documentation,

## What is IT Support?

IT Support is the area of IT strictly dedicated to supporting the uptime or network/system functionality of a system. Generally, IT Support roles can generally be categorized as technician roles and include opportunities ranging from help desk to NOC/Data Centers. This is usually more strictly in break fix and in these roles you may not understand the business functionality of the firm (because of the limited scope of the job). IT Support Tier 3 and 4 roles can include System Administrators/Engineers as well as Developers, but generally these professionals have experience as internal IT SysAdmins and as external parties.

### What makes a good System Admin?

A good SysAdmin is someone who both understands the firms needs and can adapt to the duties outlined above as well as provide high quality support. In order to do this, it involves picking the battles you fight. One example of this is how a SysAdmin may not want to mantain an on prem Microsoft Exchange server, they may choose to let Microsoft handle it through Exchange Online which would allow a migration to Outlook and for Microsoft employees to solve access issues. This would free up the SysAdmin's time to focus on other matters especially due to the 99.9%  uptime for the cloud solution SLA  (meaning about 1 day down per year). A good SysAdmin may use this time to re-assess any images of the OSes they have, update any automation related scripts, handle tickets, update documentation, etc. Good SysAdmins are NOT running around putting out fires every minute.
