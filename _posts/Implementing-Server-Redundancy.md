## Enterprise Server Redundancy:


Clustering: Resilience - Clustering provides a resilient solution by creating a group of servers that work together as a single system. It ensures high availability and minimizes downtime by automatically redistributing the workload if one server fails.

RAID: Redundancy - RAID technology offers redundancy by combining multiple physical hard drives into a single logical unit. It protects against data loss and improves fault tolerance. Different RAID levels provide various redundancy mechanisms such as mirroring, striping, or parity.

Multiple Network Interfaces: Connectivity - Having multiple network interfaces allows for redundant network connections. By bonding multiple network adapters together, you can ensure continuous network connectivity even if one adapter or network link fails.

Power Redundancy: Reliability - Power redundancy ensures reliable operation by utilizing redundant power supplies or UPS systems. If one power source fails, the redundant power supply or backup power from a UPS takes over, preventing power-related disruptions and minimizing downtime.

Offsite Data Replication: Disaster Recovery - Offsite data replication involves creating redundant copies of data in a secondary location. It provides a crucial disaster recovery measure, protecting against site-level disasters, hardware failures, or data corruption. In the event of a disaster, the replicated data can be used to restore services quickly and minimize data loss.
