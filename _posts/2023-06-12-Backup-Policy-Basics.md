### Why Do We Need A Backup Plan?
Backup plans/policies are essential because without them a business can not ensure the continuity of it's operations. For example in a company, if the production enviro goes bad, there needs to be backups to restore from in order to limit down time for the company. This is where a robust backup policy comes into play


### Basic Backup Plan: The 3-2-1 Backup Policy
One of the most time tested and common strategies used especially by small and medium businesses is the 3-2-1 strategy. This strategy involves having 3 copies of the data, with 2 of them being backup copies. one backup copy would reside on the primary disk while the other backup copy would be off-site/taken off site. This allows for some degree of disaster recovery as well, as if the business loses its facility it can back up from the off site copy to the new site. This is especially useful for smaller enterprises that can not afford to set up something like a dedicated hot site.
